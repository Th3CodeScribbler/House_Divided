In the beginning, the Corvinarus family's greatest gift was that of immense magical talent, as well as a large library of arcane resources. It wouldn't be until the youngest member of the Corvinarus family married the youngest of the Annmatar family, that they would get the renown that they desired so much.

The two individuals married were Darius Corvinarus and Ylana Annmatar. At first they didn't see eye to eye, but by the age of early twenties they became inseperable. They soon had two kids, Kryn and Elscieth. Kryn was born with magical abilities, and later became an ambitious sorcerer. Elscieth  wasn't gifted with the arcane arts, but would fill that void with charisma, and knowledge.

Kryn would marry the socialite Vivesna Loumaal, who brought Vaxillus Loumaal which was a child from a former relationship. Due to the nature of Vivesna however, her pettiness and cruelty would ultimately lead to a wedge between Kryn and his parents. Elscieth would marry a minor nobleman and have a single child, and visit the manor as often as time allowed them.

Tragedy would soon strike the Raventree Manor, as Ylana became gravely ill one summer. No doctor or specialist would be able to find a cure for the illness, which would soon take the life of Ylana. In her memory, Darius constructed a grand crypt, and would fall into a state of melancholy and reclusiveness. Years would pass until eventually Darius would come out and invite the family for a reunion to celebrate the life of Ylana, as well as discuss who would obtain the family heir. It was at this celebration that the entire Corvinarus family would vanish without a trace.
