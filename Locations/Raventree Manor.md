# Rumours

> [!danger] Malevolent Ghosts
> Locals state that the ghosts of the family attack and run off anyone that dares set foot in the place. Some state that there are ways to break the curse:
> - Spend the night and by dawn you'll be the new owner
> - Cleanse each room with a vial of holy water
> - Help each ghost with unfinished business
> - Surround the manor with salt, then invoke a divine power
> - Travel to the heart of the hedge maze where you'll find the power of the ghosts


> [!danger] Deadly Stalkers
> Anyone that sleeps in the house will be murdered and your soul ends up trapped for eternity. Only older folks of Ferncombe proclaim these rumours.


> [!danger] Portal to Hell
> Some state that demons walk the grounds of the manor, and that there is a portal to hell in the depths of the manor. Greedy individuals have traveled up to sell their souls for riches, but none have returned.


> [!danger] Giant Spiders
> Local scouts and foragers state that the old tree in the back of the manor is housing hundreds of giant spiders, large enough to eat a man in one bite. They have also seen man-shaped forms hanging from the trees.
