## Rumors of Unclaimed Land
*It was barely something one might consider important if they hadn't been paying attention— an off-handed comment between two drunkards lamenting the abandonment of a nearby parcel of land.*

> What a **waste**.

*One said, muttered into his stout.*

> All that land, sittin' there, great big house— and for what? so some noble jackass can say 'I own an estate out east.'

*The other, shaking his head vehemently.*

> I heard it's up for auction, if anyone can 'maintain' it.

*The first man spoke, emphatically.*

> And who's got the money? Can you imagine the repair? Have to be thousands of gold.

*Another headshake and a curse muttered beneath his breath.*

> Have to be. But they're waiving tax. Place is some two hundred acres.

*And that was how you first heard about the Raventree Estate—an old manor house long since abandoned, presenting an opportunity to find a place to settle, a base of operations perhaps, or maybe a chance at some treasure left behind—if the looters haven't sacked the place entirely already.*


> [!faq] Information from rumors
> If the party wanders around and talk to the townsfolk, they are able to discover some information about the Raventree Manor:
> - [ ] The estate is specifically the Raventree Manor, and has been abandoned for about twenty years.
> - [ ] The estate formally belonged to a well known and liked noble who vanished
> - [ ] Local officials confirm that although the land is legally claimed, if it is in fact abandoned, a a new party took up maintenance of the land, it could be legally transferred to the new maintainer
